# Security Policy

We take security seriously. Please report vulnerabilities **privately**.

## Supported versions

This project is currently in **alpha**. We aim to patch the latest `v0.x` as issues arise.

## Reporting a vulnerability

- **Preferred**: Open a **GitHub Security Advisory** (Repository → *Security* → *Advisories* → *Report a vulnerability*).  
  This creates a private workspace with the maintainers.

Please include:
- A clear description of the issue and potential impact
- Steps to reproduce or a minimal PoC
- Affected version/commit and environment
- Suggested fixes or mitigations (if any)

Thank you for helping keep RuleGraph users safe.
